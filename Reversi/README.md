# Reversi


**Objective**:  
Implementing a program that allows users to play the game Reversi against a computer via a GUI. Specifically, the computer moves are performed by using the Minimax algorithm and the user should be able to choose the difficulty of the game and whether to play first.



**Structure of the code**:  
The code implements the following classes:

* **State Class**: This class is used to represent the state of the board at any given time as well as the various movements of the disks. Specifically, this class includes two constructors, the default State constructor that initializes the board and the State constructor that takes the reversi character table as a parameter (an 8x8 table).
* **Game Class**: In this class, we build all the methods that are necessary for the computer to perform its movement each time. It includes the default Game constructor who initializes the search depth of the minimax algorithm to one. 
* **Main Class**: In the main class we implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to represent Reversi. The program starts and a window appears asking the user if he wants to play first and the desired level of difficulty (Easy, Medium or Hard). If the user chooses to put the disk in a box that is not allowed by the regulations or that is already occupied by another disc, a window will appear informing him that the movement is not allowed. Finally, when the game is over a window will appear informing the user if he has won or lost.
