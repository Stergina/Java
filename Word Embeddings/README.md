# Word Embeddings

**Objective**:  
The purpose of this project is to practice classical methods and models of recovery information, but also apply state ‐ of ‐ the ‐ art techniques to improve results for retrieving real data.

**Implementation**:                                                                              
- Phase 1: Baseline - Vector Space Recovery Model
- Phase 2: Application of Latent Semantic Indexing in retrieval
- Phase 3: Probabilistic and Linguistic Recovery Model
- Phase 4: Recovery using Word Embeddings
- Phase 5: Retrieval using multiple similarity functions
